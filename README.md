# Render3d
Um pequeno projeto que fiz no primeiro ano do ensino medio  //  A little project i did in my the first year of high school

it is a very very very unoptimized render whith absolutely no compatibility with another screens resolutions, and the code is very disorganized.

if by some chance you manage to open the code and run it, use wasd to move and 'o' and 'p' to zoom in and zoom out, you can use 'l', 'k', and 'j' to rotate too.
